# MAGIC __What is it?__<br>
# MAGIC The Data Science Sandbox consists of an Azure Data Lake Store and Azure Databricks, a state-of-the-art, fast cluster-based (enterprise version of Apache Spark), easy-to-use Data Science platform to foster group-wide Data Science collaboration. Its native Microsoft Azure integration supports Azure Active Directory single-sign-on and straightforward Azure Storage, SQL Data Warehouse, Cosmos DB, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, etc. connectivity. It's centrally provided and budgeted.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __What is it not?__<br>
# MAGIC It's not a Bertelsmann data integration platform.
# MAGIC It's also not a Data Science production system, it's a sandbox featuring locally provided and accessible datasets, sandbox SLAs and monthly budget limits.

# MAGIC This document is very much constantly developing, so revisit regularly to find out about the latest news.

# MAGIC __3. Shared workspace - Showcases & challenges__
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Navigate to `Workspace\Shared\` to find the following Notebook challenges and showcases in the `\Challenges` and `\Showcases` subfolders, respectively. All you need to know to run any of the showcase Notebooks, for example, in terms of the cluster run-time environment and Python library requirements, is described in the Notebooks. We have given an indication as to what type of Data Science role we believe the showcase or challenge to be of interest to in the list below, but they are indications only and, of course, should not deter anyone from having a closer look at the Notebook under consideration.
